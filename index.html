        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello. I am a recent graduate from <a href="http://uci.edu" target="_blank">University of California, Irvine</a> with a Bachelor of Science in 
            Computer Engineering. I am originally from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Milpitas,+CA+95035/@37.4314693,-
            121.9550085,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808fd1e73ae62a5f:0x7863e1c0ad3aa527!8m2!3d37.4323341!4d-121.8995741" target="_blank"> Milpitas, CA</a> 
            but am currently looking for a job around the Irvine area! While in college, I have taken classes with both Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The goal of my career is to be a full-stack 
            software engineer. I am also interested in data engineering and data analytics. I came into college not knowing what exactly I wanted to do, but that
            I wanted to create things and work with computers, hence why I chose Computer Engineering since it encompasses both the hardware and software side. My interest in
             the Computer Science aspect of Computer Engineering only grew as I became more exposed to the possibilities through classes, YouTube, and friends. I've even had the 
            pleasure of working on some cool projects myself such as a photo/video filter application and a robotic hand that was controlled by a haptic feedback glove. This website 
            is a fun little project to help myself learn pure HTML/CSS while also serving as a portfolio for myself. Throughout college, I learned MySQL, Java, C, C++, and SolidWorks, but 
            I am now self - learning Python, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript.<br><br>
            Aside from Computer Engineering, one of my favorite past times is trying great food. One of my favorite YouTubers is 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/strictlydumpling"target="_blank">StrictlyDumpling</a> and my goal is to
             try all the places that he has been too. I also love to play video games and some of my favorite games include: Valorant, Maplestory, and 
             Team Fight Tactics. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, I have also gotten into custom keyboards and building my own computer. I really enjoy picking up new 
             hobbies that I think are fun. Recently, I have been playing basketball almost daily and have started following the NBA.<br><br>
            I am always looking towards self improvement and will appreciate any feedback/advice. Below are my 
            media platforms.
